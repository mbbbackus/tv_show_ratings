# tv_show_ratings

Data retrieved from: https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

(Data not in github repository because file sizes too large)

Goal: Create user interface so that a user can enter the name of a tv show and receive a graph of that tv show's ratings by episode. Additionally I will show what the highest and lowest rated episodes are per series. 

The visualizations created by [Bo McCready](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bo.mccready8742#!/) inspired me to create this project.
